# Codebase Overview

This repository is currently a minimal scaffold.

## Current structure

- `.git/`: Git metadata and history for the repository.
- `.gitkeep`: Placeholder file that keeps the otherwise-empty repository tracked.

## What a newcomer should know

1. There is no application code yet (no `src/`, `app/`, `tests/`, or language-specific build files).
2. The repository currently serves as an initialized starting point.
3. The first meaningful architectural decision will be choosing the project type (CLI, API, web app, library, etc.) and language/tooling.

## Suggested next steps

- Add a `README.md` that states the project purpose and setup steps.
- Choose a runtime/toolchain and initialize a standard directory layout.
- Add linting/formatting and test tooling early.
- Create a small “vertical slice” feature plus at least one automated test.
